# This folder contains demos on how to use InstrumentRs 

As most people do not just have any of the instruments laying around,
this folder contains firmware for cheap microcontrollers that can demo
an instrument such that you can test the library and play with it.

## Folders:

- `rp235x`: Firmware to use a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 as a demo instrument. 
- `drivers`: InstrumentRs drivers for the demo instruments.
- `examples`: Example code to talk to demo instruments using provided InstrumentRs drivers.

The examples in the `examples` folder also contain individual readmes that explain 
how to set up the demo instruments and how to run the examples.

In order to run these demos, you will want to clone the whole InstrumentRs repository.
